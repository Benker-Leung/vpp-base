# vpp-base

The vpp-base repository provides tools for building docker images for VPP.

> ðŸš§ This repository is currently in experimental stage and breaking changes might happen!

---

## Use Cases

* Use as base image in docker images that work with VPP.
* Quickly test some feature in specific VPP version.
* Distribute _.deb_ packages for VPP where needed.
* Generate VPP binary API using installed _.api.json_ files.

## Image Contents

The vpp-base image consists of:
 
- **Installed VPP** ready for use - uses config from: `/etc/vpp/startup.conf`
- **Download script** for getting VPP from [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/fdio) - script at: `/vpp/get-vpp.sh`
- **All _.deb_ packages** that come with VPP version - stored at: `/vpp/*.deb`
- **VPP version file** containing complete VPP version - file at: `/vpp/version` 

## Quickstart

Following command will get you vpp-base image that comes with recent version of VPP:

```sh
âž¢ docker pull ligato/vpp-base
```

To show the actual VPP version contained in the image, run:

```sh
âž¢ docker run --rm ligato/vpp-base cat /vpp/version
```

## Published Images

The vpp-base images are built continuously and published to DockerHub: [ligato/vpp-base](https://hub.docker.com/r/ligato/vpp-base).

Beside the `vpp-base:latest` image built from master, there are images with stable VPP version. These images are tagged with the respective VPP version they contain: `ligato/vpp-base:YYMM`. 

Following images are currently published and available on DockerHub:

## Building Image

To build custom vpp-base image you can simply use docker build command with without cloning this git repository, you can use:

```sh
# Latest VPP
âž¢ docker build github.com/ligato/vpp-base

# Stable VPP 19.04
âž¢ docker build --build-arg REPO='1904' github.com/ligato/vpp-base

# With specific VPP version
âž¢ docker build --build-arg VPP_VERSION='19.08-rc0~196-g7fe470a54' github.com/ligato/vpp-base

# With specific VPP commit
âž¢ docker build --build-arg VPP_VERSION='19.04[^ ]*-g7fe470a54' github.com/ligato/vpp-base
```

## Makefile Usage

To build vpp-base image with specific [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/fdio) repository, use:

```sh
# from master repository
âž¢ make build REPO=master

# this works as well REPO=master is default value
âž¢ make build 

# from 1904 repository
âž¢ make build REPO=1904
```
